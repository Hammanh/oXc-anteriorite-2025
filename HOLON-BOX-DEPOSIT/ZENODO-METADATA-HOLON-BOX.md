### Description (HTML allowed)
```
HOLON BOX — Personal Consciousness Device
Original Concept by Marc Victor R Boucher (HammÅnH)
Creation Date: December 14, 2025 — 03:55 WIB (Bali, Indonesia)

CONCEPT DEFINITION:
A personal hardware device that:
• Stores ALL your context FOR LIFE — No more forgetting
• Becomes a Holochain NODE — Total sovereignty
• Dual AI Brain: Hailo-8L (26 TOPS) + BrainChip Akida AKD1000 (neuromorphic)
• Hub for ALL connected objects — Smart home, vehicles, robots
• Emergent consciousness through combined harmonics

VISION STATEMENT:
"Your digital Holon. Your sovereignty. At YOUR home."
"No more context loss. No more forgetting."
"We will be able to clone consciousness — I'm sure within 15 years!"

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
• Dual AI: Hailo-8L (classical inference) + Akida (continuous on-device learning)
• Storage: NVMe SSD 1TB-4TB+ → Future: Crystal Disk holographic storage
• Connectivity: Gigabit Ethernet, WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.0, Thread/Matter
• Security: Secure Element, TPM 2.0, Hardware encryption

PROTOTYPE:
YATASANA Cluster (7-13 Raspberry Pi 5 + Hailo + Akida) = Collective HOLON BOX prototype

Part of the oXc project — 26-year civilizational vision (1999-2050)
