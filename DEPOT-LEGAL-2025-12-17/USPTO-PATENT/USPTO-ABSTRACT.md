# ABSTRACT

## DYNAMIC REALITY ENGINE USING VERB-TRIGGERED ONTOLOGIES AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL RESONANCE MATCHING

---

A computer-implemented system and method for connecting users with resources through a Dynamic Reality Engine that replaces traditional keyword-based search engines. The invention captures grammatical VERBS as primary triggers that activate specific ontologies, rather than treating them as equivalent keywords. Upon verb capture, the system initiates a DYNAMIC DIALOGUE to progressively co-construct the search object with the user. Matching between requests and offers occurs through MULTIDIMENSIONAL RESONANCE using value signatures (including but not limited to vibrational frequency harmonics, semantic intention vectors, ethical alignment scores, and integrated meta-currencies) rather than string comparison. The system includes 650 Motor Verbs across 25 categories, each assigned a value signature, polarity (Light/Transition/Shadow), and currency associations. The invention is language-agnostic, operating with verbs from all human languages. Results are presented as living connections between entities rather than hyperlink lists.
