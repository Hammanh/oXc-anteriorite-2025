<h2 id="abstract-of-the-claims">ABSTRACT OF THE CLAIMS</h2>
<p>The claimed invention is a Dynamic Reality Engine that replaces
traditional search engines through three novel mechanisms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>treating grammatical VERBS as executable triggers that activate
specific ontologies rather than as keywords;</p></li>
<li><p>initiating DYNAMIC DIALOGUE to co-construct search objects with
users, wherein the system takes initiative;</p></li>
<li><p>matching requests with offers using MULTIDIMENSIONAL AFFINITY
SIGNATURES (comprising values, intentions, harmonic states, semantic
vectors, ethical scores, and meta-currencies) rather than string
comparison.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The system is language-agnostic, operating with verbs from all human
languages, and produces living connections between entities rather than
lists of hyperlinks.</p>
<p><strong>PROTECTION SCOPE</strong>: This patent covers ANY
implementation of verb-triggered ontology activation with
system-initiated dialogue and non-string-based matching, regardless of
the specific matching algorithm used (frequency, semantic, ethical, or
other).</p>
