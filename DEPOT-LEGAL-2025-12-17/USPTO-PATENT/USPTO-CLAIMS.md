## INDEPENDENT CLAIMS (BROADEST PROTECTION)

### Claim 1 — System Claim (CORE)

A computer-implemented system for connecting users with resources, comprising:

a) a **verb capture module** configured to identify and extract a grammatical verb as the primary element from user input, wherein said verb is treated as an executable trigger that activates a specific process, rather than as a keyword equivalent to other words;

b) an **ontology activation engine** configured to dynamically select and load a specific ontology based on the captured verb, wherein different verbs activate different ontologies with different attribute structures for the same object;

c) a **dialogue manager** configured to initiate a system-led dialogue to co-construct a structured **transaction object** (configured as a Request, an Offer, or a Need-based derivative), wherein the system takes initiative in asking questions based on the active ontology;

d) a **resonance matcher** configured to match requests with offers based on **multidimensional affinity signatures** (comprising values, intentions, semantic vectors, ethical scores, currency values, harmonic states, or any non-textual matching parameters) rather than string comparison or keyword matching; and

e) a **connection broker** configured to establish direct living connections between entities rather than providing lists of hyperlinks to static documents.

---

### Claim 2 — Method Claim (CORE)

A computer-implemented method for connecting users with resources, comprising the steps of:

a) **capturing** a grammatical verb as the first and primary element from user input, treating said verb as an action trigger rather than a search keyword;

b) **activating** a dynamic ontology corresponding to said verb, wherein the same object generates different attribute structures depending on the verb used;

c) **initiating** a system-driven progressive dialogue to construct a complete search object through iterative questioning, wherein the system takes initiative rather than passively awaiting complete queries;

d) **assigning** a multidimensional affinity signature to the constructed request based on the captured verb and dialogue responses;

e) **matching** said request with stored offers using resonance algorithms based on said value signatures rather than string matching; and

f) **establishing** a direct connection between the requesting entity and matching entities.

---

### Claim 3 — Computer-Readable Medium Claim

A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to:

a) identify a grammatical verb as an executable trigger element in user input, distinct from keywords;

b) select a dynamic ontology based on said verb;

c) generate progressive questions to construct a search object through system-initiated dialogue;

d) calculate resonance scores between requests and offers using multidimensional affinity signatures; and

e) broker direct connections between matched entities.

---

### Claim 12 — Dynamic Attribute Generation

The method of Claim 2, wherein the step of **activating** a dynamic ontology causes different attribute sets to be requested for the same object depending on the verb, such that:
- verb "SELL" activates TRANSACTION ontology with attributes: price, sale conditions, deadline;
- verb "RENT" activates RENTAL ontology with attributes: price per day, duration, deposit;
- verb "LEND" activates LOAN ontology with attributes: duration, conditions, reciprocity;
- verb "GIVE" activates DONATION ontology with attributes: conditions, beneficiary.

---

### Claim 13 — Frequency Resonance Algorithm

The method of Claim 2, wherein the **resonance matching** step using frequency harmonics comprises:

a) determining the frequency (F1) assigned to the request based on its verb;

b) determining the frequency (F2) of each stored offer;

c) calculating a resonance score using the formula:
```
IF Diff = 0 THEN Score = 1.0

## ABSTRACT OF THE CLAIMS

The claimed invention is a Dynamic Reality Engine that replaces traditional search engines through three novel mechanisms:

(1) treating grammatical VERBS as executable triggers that activate specific ontologies rather than as keywords;

(2) initiating DYNAMIC DIALOGUE to co-construct search objects with users, wherein the system takes initiative;

(3) matching requests with offers using MULTIDIMENSIONAL AFFINITY SIGNATURES (comprising values, intentions, harmonic states, semantic vectors, ethical scores, and meta-currencies) rather than string comparison.

The system is language-agnostic, operating with verbs from all human languages, and produces living connections between entities rather than lists of hyperlinks.

**PROTECTION SCOPE**: This patent covers ANY implementation of verb-triggered ontology activation with system-initiated dialogue and non-string-based matching, regardless of the specific matching algorithm used (frequency, semantic, ethical, or other).
